# Meet Corner Radius Pro 🤩

A powerful productivity add-in for PowerPoint that offers professional-grade control over shape geometry by replacing manual adjustment handles with a dedicated, high-precision input field. Designed to combine technical precision with presentation design, it transforms tedious percentage-based dragging into simple point-based typing, enabling perfectly uniform designs with just a single click.

## 🤑 FREE version includes:

### •	Precision Hybrid Input:
Features a smart dropdown (ComboBox) that allows you to pick from common point values or type in custom, precise measurements.

### •	Native Integration:
Adds a custom "Corner Radius" group to the Ribbon, perfectly aligned with standard Height and Width controls for a seamless workflow.

### •	Deep Group Support:
Apply radius changes to entire groups or drill down to specific sub-selected shapes without needing to ungroup elements.


#### Tip: Add to Quick Access Toolbar for easier interactions

## 😎 Pro version includes:
### •	Pro-Level Radius Locking:

Maintains a constant point-value radius even if a shape is resized, preventing the rounding from "stretching" or distorting.

### •	Intelligent Auto-Conversion:

Instantly transforms standard Rectangles, Text Boxes, and Ovals into Rounded Rectangles the moment you apply a radius value.

Custom "Corner Radius" groups are available on both a dedicated Corner Radius tab and the contextual Shape Format tab.
